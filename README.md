### Description:
##### "Obstacle-Coure"
> Section two of this tutorial teaches the basic understanding of game design, variables, basic collision boxes, incrementing a score, if-statements, and caching references. The overall idea of the project is to create an obstacle course that you move a object around dodging other objects and getting to the end. All the 3D assets for given for this lesson and none were created by me.
